# GitType ⌨️💻

# Discover and practice with trending GitHub repositories
gittype trending                    # Browse trending repos interactively
gittype trending rust               # Filter by language (Rust)

# Play with cached repositories interactively
gittype repo play
```

## Why GitType? 🤔

- **Look busy at work** → "I'm studying the codebase" (technically true!)
- **Beat the AI overlords** → Type faster than ChatGPT can generate
- **Stop typing boring stuff** → Your own bugs are way more interesting than lorem ipsum
- **Discover forgotten treasures** → That elegant function you wrote at 3am last year
- **Procrastinate like a pro** → It's code review, but gamified!
- **Embrace your legacy code** → Finally face those variable names you're not proud of
- **Debug your typing skills** → Because `pubic static void main` isn't a typo anymore
- **Therapeutic code reliving** → Type through your programming journey, tears included
- **Climb the dev ladder** → From "Code Monkey" to "Quantum Computer" - each rank comes with fancy ASCII art

*"Basically, you need an excuse to avoid real work, and this one's pretty good."*
