## Scoring System

### Score Calculation Formula
```
Base Score = CPM × (Accuracy / 100) × 10
```

### Metrics Explained
- **CPM** (Characters Per Minute): Total characters typed / minutes
- **WPM** (Words Per Minute): CPM / 5 (average word length)
- **Accuracy**: (Total chars - Mistakes) / Total chars × 100%

### Bonuses & Penalties
- **Consistency Bonus**: Up to 70% extra for high accuracy
- **Time Bonus**: Extra points for fast completion
- **Mistake Penalty**: -5 points per error

```
Final Score = (Base + Consistency + Time - Penalties) × 2 + 100
```

## Game Modes

### Standard Mode
